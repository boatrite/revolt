# Revolt

Successor to [mutiny](github.com/boatrite/mutiny).

Things I've done in this project:

* CMake & Conan ♥️
* Different GUI screens (initial page, new world, game)
* Variable voxel size
* Saving and loading
* Voxel raycast to pick blocks
* Bits and bobs
* And more planned

If mutiny was the renderer, this is the other bits. I suspect this will go the
same, where I spike out a bunch, learn and figure things out.
